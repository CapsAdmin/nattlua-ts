This is a Typescript port of https://github.com/CapsAdmin/NattLua which is
written in Lua

NattLua is a typed version of Lua a bit similar to Typescript.

Since NattLua is written in Lua it's becoming difficult to manage the codebase,
fix bugs and refactor

I hope that by porting it to Typescript I can get a new perspective and more
easily port it to NattLua since typescript might provide me with some ground
truth
